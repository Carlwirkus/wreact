# Wreact - A Worse React

## Why?

I wanted to learn a bit about react internals and what better way 
then trying to implement it yourself (badly).

## Scope

- [x] JSX
- [x] useState
- [x] useEffect
- [x] useRef
- [ ] useMemo
- [ ] useCallback
- [ ] useContext

#### Nice to haves

- [ ] React Query Implementation
- [ ] Tailwind
- [ ] Routing
- [ ] requestIdleCallback for rendering
- [ ] Dom Reconciliation (instead of full dom replacement)
